# ACTION PLAN 2019

## Our Three Goals

1) Build a sustainable coding community
2) Educate programmers
3) Build talent pool large enough to support building minimum viable products
for startups and support startups growing rapidly.

### Objective 1 - Build a sustainable coding community

Success looks like :: Programmers know that a vibrant developer community exists
with learning opportunities, networking events, and opportunities for work.

#### Actions:

1. Create a board tasked with running the ADA that includes a succession plan
    for 2020
2. Have a meetup every 4-6 weeks with a speaker covering a specific topic and
    provide food to attendees to encourage participation. Meetups have a
    rotating focus: soft skills, technical skills, and community development that
    are underscored once per quarter.
3. Act as a marketing vehicle for other organizations such as Girls Who Code and
    niche groups that other developers would like to start such as a game
    developer meetup. A mailing list is maintained with a monthly newsletter
    detailing out programming events each month for people to attend along
    with a Slack channel for developers to interact.
4. Have representation in the community to colleges and government
    organizations.
5. Participate in career fairs to spread awareness and provide a support system
    for programmers to interact before and after getting their first job
6. Provide a unified front to represent developers to industries that are
    interested in knowledge work based in Alaska

### Objective 2 - Educate programmers

Success looks like :: Through participation in the ADA, developers will “level up” their
skills to be more effective at work and in their personal projects.


#### Actions:

1. Meetups will be focused on specific educational topics
2. Partner with organizations to put on 3-4 day bootcamps for specific
    technologies. Topics are sourced from startup companies, employers, and
    developers looking for specific skills.
3. Bootcamps will be provided at subsidized costs to independent developers
4. Hackathons will be put on with a focus on utilizing skills learned in bootcamps
    or new technologies that reinforce new skills.

### Objective 3 - Build talent pool large enough to build MVP’s

### for startups and support startups growing rapidly

Success looks like :: A Large enough talent pool will exist that a growing company
can find the talent required to build their minimum viable product and eventually
grow a company with knowledge workers based in Alaska.

#### Actions:

1. Engage with businesses to find out what skills are needed
2. Work with programmers to foster education from level 0 to level 3 and 4
    programmers


## Events

### Meetup Details

The Dev Alliance sponsors statewide meetups every 4-6 weeks to introduce
knowledge into the community, connect members. Each location hosts a watch
party to connect in person with their geographic peers. Speakers and participating
locations can join via Zoom. Audience members can attend via livestreams on
Youtube or Facebook. A food budget will be provided to each location based on the
number of attendees and the operating budget of the Alliance.

### Community Hosted Events

Each community has the flexibility to host their own Dev Alliance branded events
provided:
- They’re hosted on weeks that the Alliance is not having an event
- The event is approved by the board
- The event is advertised to the entire Developers Alliance

### Bootcamps

Bootcamps will be events focused on learning a specific technology or skill over the
course of 3-4 days. These will be put on in partnership with an organization looking
to handle that training or as a result of community surveys to find out what skills the
ADA would like to learn. They will be subsidized as much as possible to make it
possible for independent developers to attend.

### Hackathons

Hackathons will be 1-2 day events focused on applying programmer knowledge. Our
primary focus will be on the outcome of what developers have learned as opposed to
the result of what is built. In some cases it may make sense to change this paradigm,
however, the focus should be on building to learn over the course of 1-2 days rather
than “winning” the event. Hackathons can be sponsored by businesses looking to
find developers with certain aptitudes, test technologies, or assess feasibility of their
ideas.


#### Incentives for programmers to attend:

1. Subject matter relevant to all disciplines of programmers and other relevant
    education opportunities
2. Finding work / jobs
3. Learning
4. Food
5. Networking
6. Incentives from employers to engage with the community

#### Incentives for employers to participate:

1. Educational opportunities to get programmers from beginning to
    intermediate/advanced(level 2 - level 4) and invest in the future.
2. Centralized place for employers to look for developers for specific projects and
    employees.


## Organizational Structure

We will adopt a board to handle turnover and add some redundancy for members to
step back if need-be. The organizational structure will consist of a board staffed by
ADA members and a Launch Alaska position.
Launch Alaska will serve as the fiscal sponsor for the ADA. This is includes:
- Fundraising within the Alaskan Community and corporate outreach
- Financial management (receiving sponsorships, paying expenses, accounting,
etc)
Guidance based on needs communicated from Launch Alaska Stakeholders

## Some future actions / events we might adopt

This list is malleable and will be talked about at board meetings, discussed with the
community, and change with the direction of the group.
- Training Path - treehouse curricula + mentor
- Mentorship - CS club students + dev alliance members (github model for
mentorship)
- Outreach - booth at the fair, small group hackathon to make an exhibit and
share at the fair
- Economic focus - mentorship for people to make a career transition into
development. Co-run agency / job placement to help transition new
developers
- Inverse code school - get paid to go through school, pay back with first gig
- Projects list for entry level developers to take on with developers
- Outreach to future young coders, collaborate with existing groups to help
teach programming. Maker Lab / database of people to help out - Sarah
Robinson
- Centralized calendar for events and coding based organizations


- Increased outreach on social media
- Hackathons using public (government) data
- Work with makerspace to do join workshops for hardware integration
- Dev Alliance as two sided market place
  * Who are tech oriented people?
  * Who are tech oriented companies?


## Conclusion

In order to overcome the lacking technology sector in Alaska, we must invest time
and money into fostering a community organized around learning the craft of
programming. This is the single biggest factor in the future success of Alaska's
knowledge-based economy.
